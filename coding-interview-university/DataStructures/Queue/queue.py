# Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:

#     enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
#     dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
#     empty()

# Implement using fixed-sized array:

#     enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
#     dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
#     empty()
#     full()
